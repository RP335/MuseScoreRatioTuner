# MuseScoreRatioTuner
Uses Ratios to tune two notes relative to each other

- Upon selecting two notes, the user can tune one both of them as ratios of each other, keeping one's tuning fixed and tuning the other.
- There are standard interval ratios (from unison (default) all the way to major seventh)) and there's also an option for entering a custom ratio.
- There is an option to tune the higher note to the desired ratio keeping the lower note's tuning the same as before (tune up) and the opposite of that (tune down)
- On applying the settings, a note is tuned to the ratio selected relative to the other note (which is also selected)
- This only works for two notes selected, if more than two notes are selected, the plugin throws an error message.
