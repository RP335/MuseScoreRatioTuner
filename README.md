# MuseScoreRatioTuner
Uses Ratios to tune a single note relative to another.

- upon selecting a single note
- the ratio is entered: numerator and denominator in integer format
- then the tuning (in cents of the other note relative to which the new tuning is to be done) is entered
- the plugin calculates how many cents (up/down) to tune the selected note
- The tuning is then reflected in view -> inspector -> select note -> tuning
